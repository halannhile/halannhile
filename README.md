### Hi, I'm Nhi 👋 

💡 I'm a data scientist who is learning to also become a software engineer. 

Why, you may ask. I love building ML/AI models - I believe they have a tremendous potential to make a positive impact in so many areas. But throughout my time working as a data scientist, I realized without the skill set of a software engineer, I cannot bring my models to life. I always had to rely on the software engineers in my team to handle the shipping of my models to the users of our company's website and app. 

🧩 It's like I have the full design of a house but always miss the last piece of the puzzle - the skills and materials to actually build it out and invite people over to use it. 

🌱 So, I'm on a personal quest to learn how to **build** things, both with code and with data.
