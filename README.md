### Hi, I'm Nhi ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸ’¡ I'm a data scientist who is learning to also become a software engineer. 

Why, you may ask. I love building ML/AI models - I believe they have a tremendous potential to make a positive impact in so many areas. But throughout my time working as a data scientist, I realized without the skill set of a software engineer, I cannot bring my models to life. I always had to rely on the software engineers in my team to handle the shipping of my models to the users of our company's website and app. 

ðŸ§© It's like I have the full design of a house but always miss the last piece of the puzzle - the skills and materials to actually build it out and invite people over to use it. 

ðŸŒ± So, I'm on a personal quest to learn how to **build** things, both with code and with data.

### About me:

* ðŸ’» I'm working as a Data Scientist at [Telstra](https://www.telstra.com.au/) - Australia's leading telecommunications company 
* ðŸŽ“ I graduated from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia with a Bachelor degree in Actuarial Science (where I studied a lot of cool maths and stats courses)
